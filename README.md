# Tensorflow-Coursera-Courses
I started learning about deep learning using Tensorflow.
The link of the courses from Coursera: [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice):  
## 4 courses in the courses: 
- [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
- [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
- [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
- [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)
